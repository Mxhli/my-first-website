  <span id="first" class='js'>JavaScript</span> often abbreviated JS, is a <span>programming</span> language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use <span style="font-weight: bold">  <span class='js'>JavaScript</span></span> on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated   <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
